mean_nfix_summer.R, mean_nfix_autumn.R, mean_nfix_winter.R and mean_nfix_spring.R are used to extract the total seasonal N fixation rate in the area of 
the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) from simulated eReefs results.

aust.R is used to produce the study site image

central_gbr.R is used to get the Central Great Barrier Reef (GBR) boundary coordinates

gbrmpa_bdry.R is used to compute the Nfix budgets for the GBRMP, GBR, Central GBR and cross-shelf waterbodies of the GBR. It is also used for data 
visualisation.

gbr4_surface_extraction.R is used to extract surface  for the GBR.

gam_depth.R and gam_nfix_depth.R are used to analyse emergent patterns of simulated eReefs data.

mean_tricho_summer.R, mean_tricho_spring.R, mean_dip_summer.R, mean_dip_spring.R, mean_temp_summer.R and mean_temp_spring.R is used to extract spatially 
resolved variables.

mean_variables_visualisation.R is used to visualise spatially resolved variables

verticle_profile.R is used to extract and visualise the depth profile of Trichodesmium N, Trichodesmium Chl a, Trichodesmium carbon reserves and N-fixation rate over time.

The simulated eReefs datasets can be obtained upon request.
